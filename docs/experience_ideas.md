# Experience plan

Ha Duong Minh, 2025-04-26

Once we have a demo running, we will investigate the costs and benefits of different solutions varying:

- The rag engine. Currently we have R2R, LlamaIndex and PaperQA.
- The extraction method. From raw PDFs to GROBIDed structured data to ...
- The chunking strategy. From engine defaults to engine tuned to best available plugin.
- The generation LLM. Company, model size, quantization and training type...

The experience plan involves a progressive evaluation. Start with simple questions sets and tests to rule out dumb solutions, and progressively devise performance metrics.

Consider automating the evaluation process to save time and effort and A/B testing to gamify the interface and make it clear it is a research project.

Consider comparing our RAG solutions with those of bare LLMs.

Consider offering cheaper capacities to unregistered users.

Consider offering more advanced features to premium users.
