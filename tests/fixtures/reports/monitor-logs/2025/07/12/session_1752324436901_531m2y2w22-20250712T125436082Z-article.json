Increasingly, these take the form of subsidy contracts that are awarded through competitive bidding to projects that bid the lowest amount of subsidy in an auction. These mechanisms vary over time and across jurisdictions, particularly with respect to the design of the contract that determines the subsidy paid, which can range from a fixed feed-in tariff to a system of pure feed-in premiums to more complex systems of sliding feed-in premiums. The design of these contracts has consequences on the incentives transmitted to the developers of renewable power plants, consequences on the risk borne by investors, and can sometimes open the way to strategic behavior detrimental to the objectives pursued by the public authorities. This thesis attempts to analyze these different dimensions through a microeconomic modeling of the behavior of firms subsidized to develop solar and wind power plants, using tools from contract theory and auction theory. Elements of quantification are introduced through bottom-up modeling of the electricity system and the production of wind and solar power in France.In particular, the location of power plants or technical choices (e.g., the types of wind turbines to be installed, the orientation of solar panels) depend on how exposed (or not) firms are to price signals from electricity markets. These price signals induce firms to place a higher value on projects that are likely to produce when electricity is most expensive, provided that their revenues depend on market electricity prices. This is the case with feed-in premium systems, but not with fixed feed-in tariffs. Although significant, the role of these incentives must be weighed against the increased risk to firms created by exposure to market electricity prices, which is likely to be reflected in higher risk premiums that will be factored into the bids submitted in the auction that determines the level of subsidy. Simulations of the electricity system presented in this paper show that in France in the late 2010s, the increase in risk premiums that would result from a pure feed-in premium subsidy scheme is an order of magnitude higher than the welfare gains that would result from better incentives for developers. However, some systems of sliding feed-in premiums can keep the risk for investors low while improving the incentives for developers, as long as these systems are well designed (which is not true of all systems in place in Europe today). However, the growing share of intermittent renewables in the electricity mix may change these conclusions in the longer term.Although risk limitation for investors is found to be an important issue in the design of subsidy contracts, this paper also highlights the pitfalls of trying to insure investors against the production risk of their projects (which depends, inter alia, on weather conditions): it is shown that contract designs aimed at insuring against this risk are very likely to induce strategic behavior on the part of developers that would lead to additional costs and/or inefficiencies in the development of renewable energy. This observation applies in particular to the mechanism used by France for offshore wind in the early 2010s.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Cl√©ment Leblanc (2023)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2023\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Microeconomic analysis of subsidy mechanisms for power generation from wind and solar sources\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Cl√©ment Leblanc (2023)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/tel-04269809\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">üîó</span>\n                HALId: tel-04269809\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-hal-04510798-msg-1752324876072\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">2a, 2b</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Energy efficiency policy in an n-th best world: Assessing the implementation gap\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"The market failures and behavioral anomalies at the source of the Energy Efficiency Gap tend to be studied in isolation, which biases welfare assessment of energy efficiency policies. We develop a dynamic model of home energy retrofit fit for capturing cumulative inefficiencies due to multiple frictions -- CO2 externality, cold-related illness, credit rationing, landlord-tenant dilemma, free-riding in multi-family housing, present bias and status quo bias. Focusing on France, we find that health, rental and multi-family frictions each entail higher deadweight losses than the CO2 externality alone. Taking all frictions into account implies that energy efficiency subsidies generate net social benefits -- at odds with previous findings. In contrast, the benefit-cost balance of regulations is net negative due to ancillary costs. Finally, the French policy portfolio, which blends subsidies, taxes and regulations, only closes half of the energy efficiency gap. Its efficiency could be improved by better targeting low-income families, multi-family housing and rental housing.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Lucas Vivier, Louis-Ga√´tan Giraudet (2024)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2024\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Energy efficiency policy in an n-th best world: Assessing the implementation gap\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Lucas Vivier, Louis-Ga√´tan Giraudet (2024)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-04510798\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">üîó</span>\n                HALId: hal-04510798\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-halshs-01557657-msg-1752324876072\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">3a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"On the benefits of set-asides\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"Set-asides programs consist in forbidding access to specific participants, and they are commonly used in procurement auctions.

This exclusion principle is generalized to auction formats that favor the incumbent in the sense that he would always gets the good when he values it most. By contrast, set-asides need not be desirable if the incumbent&#39;s payoff is included into the seller&#39;s objective or in environments with multiple incumbents.

It uses a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù computable general equilibrium model of an open economy in a one-step projection from 2005 to 2035. It models second-best economies, notably skill-related rigidities in the labour market and in production of electricity. Seven scenarios for recycling of carbon tax revenue are analysed, plus an option to invest a part of tax revenue in improvement of skills of labour.The analysis shows that under conventional assumptions about technological change, a carbon tax of around 100 ZAR2005 (18 USD2013) per tonne of CO2 will have little negative consequences for GDP and employment, when combined with the right type of tax revenue recycling: Labour subsidies and company profit tax reduction likely lead to the best macro-economic outcomes, though do not reduce inequality. Additional measures are needed to reduce ‚Äúenergy poverty‚Äù. To achieve South Africa‚Äôs NDC of the Paris Agreement, a carbon tax rate of around 300 ZAR2005 or 55 USD2013 per tonne of CO2 is necessary. However, this could have serious impacts on GDP growth. Also, without a change in the trend of increasing labour productivity, such lower GDP will lead to higher unemployment than in the reference case. An investment in skills of 7.5 billion ZAR2005 of annual Ctax revenue, with the objective of increasing access to high quality education and reducing the high skill labour shortage, if fond to have a very positive impact on GDP growth. However better calibration data is required.The findings of this PhD thesis furthermore call for thorough examination of what type of technological change could be expected for South Africa. Technological progress, consumer preferences and international circumstances limit the economy‚Äôs capacity to restructure and decarbonise and therefore to reduce negative consequences of carbon taxation for GDP growth. Proper assessment of future technological change is relevant for all sectors and inputs. Examples are given which show that energy and materials efficiency have an important role for future GDP growth under carbon constraints, because they determine the economy‚Äôs flexibility to reduce energy consumption and to substitute it, e.g. by labour. This finding normally holds not only for South Africa, but also for the rest of the world. These results also imply that international climate policy has to address technology transfer and the different potentials of national economies to decarbonise seriously.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Jules Schers (2018)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2018\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Economic growth, unemployment and skills in South Africa : An Analysis of different recycling schemes of carbon tax revenue\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Jules Schers (2018)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/tel-02293182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">üîó</span>\n                HALId: tel-02293182\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        </div>\n    "
