        "generated_answer": "To address WP6, which focuses on developing a theoretical AI-Powered Energy Management Model, several relevant points from the provided context can be integrated:\n\n1. **Implementation of Machine Learning Techniques**:\n   - The context mentions the development of models for simulation and control of micro-grids, which includes the deployment of monitoring tools and the collection of measurement data [492e5a4], [ce7e684]. This aligns with the goal of implementing machine learning techniques such as Markov models and neural networks to optimize grid efficiency.\n   - The development of identification methods to correct and increase the quantitative capacity of prediction models [492e5a4], [ce7e684] supports the use of advanced machine learning techniques for grid optimization.\n\n2. **Creating Predictive Models**:\n   - The context discusses the development of predictive models for simulation and control of micro-grids, including the use of weather and occupant behavior forecasts to develop anticipative and real-time control algorithms [6679bf9]. This directly supports the creation of predictive models for demand forecasting, outage prevention, and real-time grid monitoring.\n   - The development of models and optimization strategies for optimal anticipative and reactive management of micro-grids [492e5a4], [ce7e684] further supports the goal of creating predictive models for grid management.\n\n3. **Deliverables**:\n   - The context mentions the development of technical reports and academic manuscripts as part of the research projects [492e5a4], [ce7e684], [6679bf9]. This aligns with the deliverables specified for WP6.\n\nIn summary, the context provides strong support for the implementation of machine learning techniques and the creation of predictive models for smart grid management. The deliverables of technical reports and academic manuscripts are also well-aligned with the proposed activities.",

              "description": "Like Net-Zero GHG emissions (NZE) country goals which have recently multiplied, national low carbon strategies currently focus on reducing direct territorial emissions across sectors, such as domestic energy, transport, buildings and industry sectors. Doing so they do not tackle emissions embodied in imports and insufficiently emissions related to base carbon-intensive materials production which are used across sectors including for capital formation. However the carbon footprint of materials production (CFM) represents a high share of global emissions and is mostly embodied in imports in many rich countries. Here we develop a novel framework to assess and map the carbon footprint of materials at the country level in the present situation and in future scenarios. Replicable for other countries, our framework is applied to the case of France. We find that although territorial emissions from materials supply only stand for 53 MtCO2eq in 2015, the CFM amounts to 228 MtCO2eq, i.e. 3.4 tCO2e/cap with a high share of imported emissions. Furthermore, we show that current NZE strategy only reduces the carbon footprint by 46% by 2050 compared to 2015 as it barely abates the CFM. All final goods and services contribute meaningfully to the current and future CFM, in particular final services. Mapping the French CFM across supply chains and trade flows allows to identify key policy interventions towards more sustainable NZE strategies",

These forecasts partly rest on significant efforts by the scientific community over the past three decades to improve knowledge of the interactions between economic growth and the environment; particularly modelling methods have developed to become increasingly applied to the assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of various energy demand and greenhouse gas policies. However, the significantly diverging viewpoints of models developed by energy engineers, or ‘bottom-up’ (BU) models, and those developed by economists, or ‘top-down’ (TD) models, hinder effective dialogue and mutual understanding between researchers from different academic backgrounds. The purpose of this paper is to promote a constructive dialogue between modellers from each side of the modelling paradigms, based on a comparative critique of the BU TIAM-FR model and the TD IMACLIM-R model. The comparison terms extend from the theoretical foundations of each model to their structure and specifications, and applicability to policy assessment. Preliminary numerical simulations are developed to demonstrate the relevance of linking the two models, while the technical challenges and methodological limitations of coupled simulations are addressed.",

We use an ensemble of global integrated assessment models to assess CO2 emissions reduction potentials in buildings and transport, accounting for system interactions. We focus on three intervention strategies with distinct emphases: reducing or changing activity, improving technological efficiency and electrifying energy end use. We find that these strategies can reduce emissions by 51–85% in buildings and 37–91% in transport by 2050 relative to a current policies scenario (ranges indicate model variability). Electrification has the largest potential for direct emissions reductions in both sectors. Interactions between the policies and measures that comprise the three strategies have a modest overall effect on mitigation potentials. However, combining different strategies is strongly beneficial from an energy system perspective as lower electricity demand reduces the need for costly supply-side investments and infrastructure.",

              "description": "La thèse porte sur les évolutions possibles du modèle tarifaire français dans un contexte de transition énergétique : développement de la mobilité électrique, décentralisation de la production électrique. Elle analyse ces enjeux d’un point de vue économique et sociologique. Elle traite des conséquences du développement des énergies renouvelables sur les courbes de charge résiduelles des postes sources de réseau de transport (différence entre la consommation et la production locale décentralisée). Un modèle qui prend en entrée des scénarios nationaux de prospective et qui effectue une descente d’échelle à la maille des postes sources a été développé, afin d’explorer les enjeux de calibrage du réseau dans un contexte de production plus ou moins décentralisée. Les résultats montrent que le développement des énergies renouvelables va fortement modifier les formes des courbes de charge résiduelles et les relations entre les variables utilisées pour construire le tarif du réseau de transport. Ces effets seront particulièrement importants sur les postes desservant des zones rurales : ce sont des postes caractérisés par de faibles consommations électriques mais qui sont destinés à accueillir des capacités de production électrique décentralisée. Ensuite, les travaux portent sur les hétérogénéités des coûts réseaux. Le principe de solidarité territoriale et la péréquation tarifaire font que les fortes disparités géographiques de coûts réseaux ne sont actuellement pas retranscrites dans les tarifs électriques. Un travail important de constitution d’une base de données géographique des coûts réseaux à l’horizon 2030, a été effectué. L’analyse de ces données met en évidence de très fortes disparités de coûts par habitant entre les communes urbaines et rurales. A horizon 2030, les investissements ont tendance à augmenter cet écart entre coût moyen urbain et rural : ils sont plus importants en volume par habitant dans les zones rurales. Cependant, les mouvements de population semblent contrarier cet effet si bien que la répartition semble plus égalitaire en 2030 qu’en 2020. Enfin, il semble que la répartition géographique des investissements ne remette pas en cause l’existence de la péréquation tarifaire. Puis l’analyse des différentiations géographiques en s’intéressant à l’autoproduction collective, objet assez récent dans le système électrique et dont la définition est encore en train de se préciser. Un modèle d’autoconsommation collective à la maille communale a été développé. La rentabilité de l’autoconsommation collective communale sera différenciée selon les capacités disponibles au sein des communes. L’incertitude liée à la régulation est très importante, mais elle reste du deuxième ordre par rapport à l’incertitude sur les prix des combustibles fossiles. Enfin, la thèse traite des attentes des acteurs vis-à-vis du tarif réglementé de vente, objet issu de nombreuses négociations et discussions entre les parties prenantes. L’émergence de nouveaux acteurs et le contexte de la transition énergétique pourraient conduire ce tarif à porter de nouvelles missions de politique publique. Les arguments mobilisés par les acteurs appartiennent à des champs différents : économiques, politiques, sociaux ou environnementaux. Ils mobilisent également des arguments relevant de la justice. En conclusion, les méthodes de construction tarifaire doivent être modifiées pour traiter correctement de la nouvelle forme des courbes de charge sous peine de ne pas arriver à accomplir les missions qui seront visées par le tarif. Certains principes de tarification peuvent et doivent être conservés : les évolutions des coûts et de la demande ne justifient pas la remise en question de la péréquation tarifaire et elle reste également fondamentale pour un nombre important d’enquêtés. Enfin, les missions accomplies par le tarif devraient être décidées collectivement et s’inscrire dans une réflexion globale sur la politique énergétique.",

              "description": "Optimizing an energy system model featuring a large proportion of variable (non-dispatchable) renewable energy requires a fine temporal resolution and a long period of weather data to provide robust results. Many models are optimized over a limited set of 'representative' periods (e.g. weeks) but this precludes a realistic representation of long-term energy storage. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new method based on a variable time-step. Critical periods that may be important for dimensioning part of the electricity system are defined, during which we use an hourly temporal resolution. For the other periods, the temporal resolution is coarser. This method brings very accurate results in terms of system cost, curtailment, storage losses and installed capacity, even though the optimization time is reduced by a factor of around 60. Results are less accurate for battery volume. We conclude that further research into this 'variable time-step' method would be worthwhile.",
