Using a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model, IMACLIM-R, we demonstrate that these overarching targets do not dominate the interim transportation targets when the carbon policy triggering compliance with the mitigation objectives boils down to the theoretical least-cost option of uniform carbon pricing. Ground transportation is confirmed as quite insensitive to high carbon prices, even when such prices are applied over a long term. It is tempting to conclude that pursuing the mitigation objectives specific to transportation will impose unnecessary costs. However, because of the second best conditions prevailing in actual economies, and of the risk of lock-in in carbon intensive trajectories, we conclude with the urgent need for some ambitious transport-specific policy design research agenda.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"FrÃ©dÃ©ric Ghersi, Simon Mcdonnell, Olivier Sassi (2013)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2013\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Do overarching mitigation objectives dominate transport-specific targets in the EU?\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">FrÃ©dÃ©ric Ghersi, Simon Mcdonnell, Olivier Sassi (2013)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.11.048\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                DOI: 10.1016/j.enpol.2012.11.048\n            </a>\n        \n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-00787890\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                HALId: hal-00787890\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-tel-04481011-msg-1752170350460\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">2a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Producing economy-wide outlooks of energy transitions: hybrid modelling open to second best constraints\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"FrÃ©dÃ©ric Ghersi (2019)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2019\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Producing economy-wide outlooks of energy transitions: hybrid modelling open to second best constraints\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">FrÃ©dÃ©ric Ghersi (2019)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/tel-04481011\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                HALId: tel-04481011\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-halshs-00797976-msg-1752170350460\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">3a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"An &quot;acceptable&quot; low carbon scenario for France: Participatory scenario design and economic assessment\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"The implementation of climate policies is often hindered by a lack of acceptability as well as the lack of long-term vision of stakeholders. Mitigation scenarios exercises allow the debate; however the scenario design process lacks transparency and stakeholders&#39; (and citizens&#39;) involvement, which leads to a lack of credibility, legitimacy and ownership of mitigation scenarios. This paper presents a process for the collaborative design of an &quot;acceptable&quot; mitigation scenario through a public dialogue involving fifty stakeholders. Stakeholders selected the mitigation policies and measures they deemed acceptable. They significantly contributed to the development of the scenario methodology as well, by defining its specifications including data transparency, sensitivity analysis and the need to clarify certain types of economic and financial impacts for the evaluation of Factor 4 scenarios. The acceptable policies were integrated into the hybrid CGE model Imaclim-R France. This modeling platform, designed for the dialogue between modelers, stakeholders and experts, evaluates the social, economic and financial impact of climate policies. This attempt at a methodology exemplifies a collaborative scenario design, thereby proving that such a process can be implemented. The scenario based on the measures that stakeholders deemed acceptable reduce CO2 emissions by 68% by 2050 compared to 1990, which is a result close to the target of the Factor 4 (75%). The measures to reduce emissions are beneficial for employment and economic growth, except in the short term. They can also reduce rapidly and permanently the households&#39; budget dedicated to energy services. Finally, the financial assessment of measures is positive throughout the period. This result is a solid foundation on which to build the acceptability of mitigation trajectories. Beyond the scenario, the methodological innovation offers the means to increase the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Ruben Bibas, Sandrine Mathy, Meike Fink (2012)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2012\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    An \"acceptable\" low carbon scenario for France: Participatory scenario design and economic assessment\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Ruben Bibas, Sandrine Mathy, Meike Fink (2012)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/halshs-00797976\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                HALId: halshs-00797976\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-doi-10-37394-23207-2023-20-45-msg-1752170350460\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">4a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Food Production and Amazon Preservation are Not Mutually Exclusive: Exploring Feasible Avenues from the Perspective of Land Use Related NDCs in Brazil\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"The COP21 Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) have proven to be milestones in the operationalization of climate action at the country-level, particularly in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. In Brazil, AFOLU-related NDC actions in its first version envisaged the elimination of, for instance: illegal deforestation in the Amazon region, the restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of severely degraded lands, and the substantial expansion of sustainably produced biofuels by 2030. While Brazilian Government commitment to these NDC targets soon vanished, a specific analytical question concerns as to how far sustainable land use scenarios can contribute to non-climate benefits (i.e., socioeconomic development) despite their internal challenges of harmonizing them with environmental protection and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we analyse the potential socioeconomic and environmental synergies and trade-offs in NDC implementation, given the possibility of the demand for land in Brazil increase due to agricultural and livestock expansion. We focus our analysis on GDP growth, income distribution, and food security. We do so by integrating land-use with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and running policy scenarios, emulating different levels of NDC and development policy implementation. Our analysis helps us to understand how social and economic outcomes do change under varying levels of commitment by decision-makers. It shows that NDC implementation in Brazil is preferable to a business-as-usual development pathway, particularly when climate change is taken into consideration. While GDP and household income appear unaffected by NDC implementation, reducing the pressure over Amazon deforestation along with other social benefits appears under more stringent NDC implementation. Those results are particularly important given the significant upward trend in Amazon deforestation recorded in the last few years and the loss of purchasing power of low-income classes observed since 2015 in Brazil. In the AFOLU sector, NDC implementation, as in its first version, could thus act as entry points for alternative development pathways. For instance, such as the ones discussed under green economy or low carbon growth paradigms - although, possible trade-offs between agricultural and other sectors will still need to be closely monitored.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"William Wills, Marcelo Moreira, Martin Obermaier, Julien Lefevre, Romulo Ely (2023)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2023\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Food Production and Amazon Preservation are Not Mutually Exclusive: Exploring Feasible Avenues from the Perspective of Land Use Related NDCs in Brazil\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">William Wills, Marcelo Moreira, Martin Obermaier, Julien Lefevre, Romulo Ely (2023)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.37394/23207.2023.20.45\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                DOI: 10.37394/23207.2023.20.45\n            </a>\n        \n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-04047476\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">ðŸ”—</span>\n                HALId: hal-04047476\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-hal-01734872-msg-1752170350460\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">5a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Reconciling top-down and bottom-up energy/economy models: a case of TIAM-FR and IMACLIM-R\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"Recent global economic and environmental forecasts consistently show a trend of continuous decline in natural resources, degradation of environmental quality, increasing vulnerability of economic growth as a result of environmental stress, competition for land and natural resources, soaring energy prices and climate change. These forecasts partly rest on significant efforts by the scientific community over the past three decades to improve knowledge of the interactions between economic growth and the environment; particularly modelling methods have developed to become increasingly applied to the assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of various energy demand and greenhouse gas policies. However, the significantly diverging viewpoints of models developed by energy engineers, or â€˜bottom-upâ€™ (BU) models, and those developed by economists, or â€˜top-downâ€™ (TD) models, hinder effective dialogue and mutual understanding between researchers from different academic backgrounds. The purpose of this paper is to promote a constructive dialogue between modellers from each side of the modelling paradigms, based on a comparative critique of the BU TIAM-FR model and the TD IMACLIM-R model. The comparison terms extend from the theoretical foundations of each model to their structure and specifications, and applicability to policy assessment.

This is the result of a general equilibrium model that incorporates an urban module. Under a baseline global scenario with Kyoto emissions reduction objectives, the overall economic costs can be reduced over time thanks to additional actions taken at the local level. This is due to complementaries with other objectives such as lower local pollution which enhances city attractiveness and competitiveness. The section also discusses other types of local co-benefits of climate change policies including, health improvements and quality of life, cost savings and increased efficiency, as well as energy security and infrastructure improvements.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"F.
