All the investment barriers faced by households invite us to explore the investment factors and to assess the efficiency of public policies. In a first part, the thesis studies the investment factors by estimating a discrete choice model on data from the French annual “Energy Management” survey conducted by Ademe, particularly focusing on factors heterogeneity among retrofitting types. A second part of the thesis deals with the assessment of public policy promoting energy efficiency, both from the demand and the supply sides of the energy efficiency markets. Regarding the demand side, the thesis uses two complementary methods: an ex-post econometric study focuses on the French tax credit called Crédit d’Impôt Développement Durable implemented in 2005 while an ex-ante study uses a hybrid energy-economy model to compare different policies. Regarding the supply side, given the high degree of concentration on the energy efficiency markets, we use a theoretical model to assess public policy efficiency in the presence of three markets imperfections: the negative externality linked to CO2 and the imperfections of market competition and information inducing price-quality discrimination.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Marie-Laure Nauleau (2015)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2015\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR : ANALYSIS ON INVESTMENT DRIVERS AND PUBLIC POLICIES\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Marie-Laure Nauleau (2015)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/tel-01618117\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                HALId: tel-01618117\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-doi-10-1016-j-eneco-2022-105941-msg-1752138992570\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">2a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Air pollution and CO2 from daily mobility: Who emits and Why?

These changes could have important health co-benefits. We aimed to quantify the health benefits of physical activity caused by active transportation on all-cause mortality in the French negaWatt scenario over the 2021–2050 period. Methods; Relying on a health impact assessment framework, we quantified the health benefits of increased walking, cycling and E-biking projected in the negaWatt scenario. The negaWatt scenario assumes increases of walking and cycling volumes of +11% and +612%, respectively, over the study period. Results: As compared to a scenario with no increase in volume of active travel, we quantified that the negaWatt scenario would prevent 9,797 annual premature deaths in 2045 and translate into a 3-month increase in life expectancy in the general population. These health gains would generate €34 billion of economic benefits from 2045 onwards. Conclusion: Increased physical activity implied in the negaWatt transition scenario would generate substantial public health benefits, which are comparable to the gain expected by large scale health prevention interventions.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Marion Leroutier, Philippe Quirion (2022)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2022\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Air pollution and CO2 from daily mobility: Who emits and Why?
