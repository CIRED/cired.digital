                "description": "Climate change is representative of a general class of environmental issues where decisions have to be taken under controversies. The policy framework for these kinds of decisions is defined by three important traits: scientific ignorance, mediatization and the need for innovation. Scientific ignorance is an issue here because decisions must be taken before the end of scientific controversies about the predictability of future climate. Mediatization is key because agents can't have a sensible experience of the global climate change, and some interest-holders (future generations, distant countries) cannot participate directly in the decision. Third, the need for innovation is crucial because today's technology offers the only alternative between fossil fuels and nuclear power as a main primary energy source.In the case of climate change, the institutional context is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The making of global environmental policy is framed not upon a hypothetical code of international law (there is no such a thing), but upon a body of doctrine arising from consistent reference to a given set of principles. The key principles are sustainability (satisfying the need of present generations without preventing future generations to satisfy theirs), precaution (ignorance is not an excuse for inaction), the common but differentiated responsibility (developed countries take the lead in action against climate change), and economic efficiency (which lead to prefer flexible instruments over blind regulation).Given the scientific controversies and the fuzziness of guiding principles, no clear-cut demonstration could justify the choice of a theoretically optimum course of action, even in the short term. Historically, climate negotiations can be seen as an oscillation between two regulation modes. On one side is coordinated policies and measures, where countries adopt an uniform international rate of carbon tax. On the other side is emission trading, where a defined emission reduction target is allocated to each country.",

La revue des approches de la décision ---utilisant ou non les probabilités subjectives--- montre que la première représentation de la précaution est le modèle de décision séquentielle. Dans ce cadre, ce texte présente les résultats du modèle intégré DIAM résolu en programmation dynamique stochastique concernant la question du tempo de l'action contre le changement climatique. La seconde partie de l'ouvrage propose une vision alternative de la précaution, basée sur le rejet de l'axiome de complétude des préférences de Savage. Cela conduit à définir un critère de décision rationnel en situation d'information imprécise. Ce critère est discuté avec la théorie des probabilités imprécises, en visant à unifier les différentes approches proposées dans la littérature (Shackle et Zadeh, Dempster et Shafer, Smets, Gilboa et Schmeidler, Walley). Les applications présentées en troisième partie concernent la causalité en épidémiologie, l'élicitation et la fusion des opinions d'experts ainsi que les règles de la prospective.",

Vietnam has potential to inspire other nations and suggests concrete actions to attract investment, develop human resources, and collaborate with international partners, especially France and Europe, in the field of renewable energy. The vision for Vietnam is to harness its strategic advantages, such as its location, vibrant economy, and commitment to green growth, to showcase how a country can achieve rapid economic development while transitioning to a low-carbon future. The interview discusses key strategies, policies, and initiatives that Vietnam should prioritize, with a focus on green finance, innovation, just energy transition, international cooperation, and capacity building in the energy sector.",

              "description": "The kernel of this dissertation aims to exploit by optimisation methods and empirical studies the issues of sustainable development in the Vietnamese power sector for the next thirty years. It then examines the ways to implement sustainable energy options for the power sector in practice. To accomplish these two objectives, the study focuses on different, but related, issues with these two methodologies: (i) In the first part, we develop the bottom-up Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) model to provide a more exhaustive assessment of the current state and future prospects for the Vietnamese power sector in next three decades. Then, using a comparative analysis and a vulnerability analysis that is based on the IRP simulation, we analyze energy-development-related vulnerabilities that the sector could face, in terms of economic and socioenvironmental dimensions. We further develop the IRP model, in such a way representing realistically the marginal abatement costs of carbon emission reduction by considering non-zero carbon values and carbon emission constraints, in order to simulate sustainable energy supply options for the power sector. (ii) In the second part, we study the major barriers against the wider adoption of sustainable energy development options in practice by using analytical hierarchy process-based formal surveys among national experts. Then, we use an empirical analysis approach to examine different appropriate policy means including incentive instruments/schemes and sector reform for such sustainability of the power sector. To the end, we analyze the access to feasible financing sources for sustainable development in the Vietnamese power sector.",

              "description": "Climate change is representative of a general class of environmental issues where decisions have to be taken under controversies. The policy framework for these kinds of decisions is defined by three important traits: scientific ignorance, mediatization and the need for innovation. Scientific ignorance is an issue here because decisions must be taken before the end of scientific controversies about the predictability of future climate. Mediatization is key because agents can't have a sensible experience of the global climate change, and some interest-holders (future generations, distant countries) cannot participate directly in the decision. Third, the need for innovation is crucial because today's technology offers the only alternative between fossil fuels and nuclear power as a main primary energy source.In the case of climate change, the institutional context is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The making of global environmental policy is framed not upon a hypothetical code of international law (there is no such a thing), but upon a body of doctrine arising from consistent reference to a given set of principles. The key principles are sustainability (satisfying the need of present generations without preventing future generations to satisfy theirs), precaution (ignorance is not an excuse for inaction), the common but differentiated responsibility (developed countries take the lead in action against climate change), and economic efficiency (which lead to prefer flexible instruments over blind regulation).Given the scientific controversies and the fuzziness of guiding principles, no clear-cut demonstration could justify the choice of a theoretically optimum course of action, even in the short term. Historically, climate negotiations can be seen as an oscillation between two regulation modes. On one side is coordinated policies and measures, where countries adopt an uniform international rate of carbon tax. On the other side is emission trading, where a defined emission reduction target is allocated to each country.",

La revue des approches de la décision ---utilisant ou non les probabilités subjectives--- montre que la première représentation de la précaution est le modèle de décision séquentielle. Dans ce cadre, ce texte présente les résultats du modèle intégré DIAM résolu en programmation dynamique stochastique concernant la question du tempo de l'action contre le changement climatique. La seconde partie de l'ouvrage propose une vision alternative de la précaution, basée sur le rejet de l'axiome de complétude des préférences de Savage. Cela conduit à définir un critère de décision rationnel en situation d'information imprécise. Ce critère est discuté avec la théorie des probabilités imprécises, en visant à unifier les différentes approches proposées dans la littérature (Shackle et Zadeh, Dempster et Shafer, Smets, Gilboa et Schmeidler, Walley). Les applications présentées en troisième partie concernent la causalité en épidémiologie, l'élicitation et la fusion des opinions d'experts ainsi que les règles de la prospective.",
