I conduct a literature review to assess the current state of IAM-IO integration, paving the way for future research opportunities with advanced models. Existing studies have loosely linked IAM and IO models to improve one field or the other. This perspective highlights the potential for more advanced IAM-IO model linking and identifies three domains within sustainability scenarios research where IAM-IO integration could play a crucial role : the energy-industry nexus in decarbonization pathways, multi-dimensional sustainability impact assessment and demand-side solutions and post-growth climate mitigation scenarios.

But, fast and deep transformations will have wide-ranging economic implications at the macroeconomic level, in energy industries, and also in other sectors. Such impacts need to be understood by policy-makers. This paper develops an original integrated approach based on loading consolidated energy pathways into a multi-sector economy-wide model to assess within a consistent framework the multi-level economic impacts of the DD strategies. The method is applied to Argentina and gives representative insights into the global challenge to move towards a low-carbon economy. Our results show key multi-level impacts of shifting from a &#39;reference&#39; to a DD pathway by 2050. In energy industries, value-added and employment shift from fossil fuel to low-carbon power industries. Aggregated GDP and welfare impacts are limited but incremental investments are significant at the macroeconomic level, with indirect and induced impacts across the economy. It includes net job creations in upstream industries that supply low-carbon infrastructures, but also risks of job losses in exposed sectors. Eventually, our approach highlights enabling conditions and possible block points to lift to trigger the transition.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Gaëlle Le Treut, Julien Lefevre, Francisco Lallana, Gonzalo Bravo (2021)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2021\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    The multi-level economic impacts of deep decarbonization strategies for the energy system\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Gaëlle Le Treut, Julien Lefevre, Francisco Lallana, Gonzalo Bravo (2021)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112423\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                DOI: 10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112423\n            </a>\n        \n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-03663085\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                HALId: hal-03663085\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-hal-tel-05094058-msg-1752138352746\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">5a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Lever les obstacles aux investissements bas-carbone : explorations quantitatives à l&#39;aide de Modèles d&#39;Évaluation Intégrée\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"Les modèles d&#39;évaluation intégrée (IAM) sont des outils essentiels pour éclairer les décisions de politiques climatiques. Historiquement, ils ont été utilisés pour identifier des trajectoires de transition coût-efficaces vers des futurs soutenables. A la suite de l&#39;Accord de Paris, la demande des décideurs publics se concentre de façon croissante sur l&#39;évaluation de paquets de politiques concrets, afin d&#39;évaluer leur impact sur les trajectoires d&#39;émissions régionales et mondiales. Pour cela, les IAM doivent dépasser leur approche technico-économique, pour mieux représenter les conditions réelles d&#39;investissement et l&#39;incidence des politiques climatique sur le déploiement des technologies bas-carbone. Quels obstacles freinent l&#39;adoption et les investissements dans les technologies bas-carbone ? Comment les représenter dans des modèles comme les IAM ? Et quel impact leur prise en compte a-t-elle sur l&#39;évaluation des conditions d&#39;accélération de l&#39;atténuation du changement climatique et les stratégies de politiques climatiques associées?Cette thèse mobilise le modèle d&#39;évaluation intégrée IMACLIM-R, en l&#39;enrichissant d&#39;avancées méthodologiques et conceptuelles pour mieux répondre à ces questions. Le premier chapitre présente les améliorations apportées à IMACLIM-R pour intégrer les défis liés à l&#39;intégration des énergies renouvelables variables (ENRi) dans les systèmes électriques régionaux. Il montre que les freins à la diffusion des ENRi, désormais matures, ne résident essentiellement plus dans leurs coûts techniques.Le deuxième chapitre mobilise cinq IAM pour analyser l&#39;impact de la réduction des coûts de financement des ENRi dans les pays émergents. En explorant des scénarios de réduction des risques perçus par les investisseurs, il démontre l&#39;importance de l&#39;accès équitable à la finance pour accélérer le déploiement des ENRi dans ces régions.Le troisième chapitre approfondit l&#39;analyse précédente en intégrant les institutions financières internationales dans IMACLIM-R, en tant qu&#39;acteurs capables de réduire les coûts de financement, à la fois en apportant du capital mais aussi en mobilisant la finance privée. Ce chapitre montre comment ces institutions, en réduisant les risques pour les investisseurs privés, peuvent créer un environnement favorable aux investissements renouvelables, en particulier dans les pays en développement.Le quatrième chapitre explore une deuxième barrière aux investissements dans les technologies bas-carbones: la faible crédibilité des engagements climatiques. Il montre que si les agents économiques perçoivent les politiques climatiques (ici, le prix du carbone) comme peu fiables, la rentabilité espérée des technologies bas-carbone se détériore, ce qui désincite leur adoption. Ce chapitre met en lumière l&#39;importance d&#39;aligner les anticipations des décideurs privés avec les objectifs climatiques pour atteindre ces derniers.En conclusion, cette thèse apporte des éclairages quantitatifs sur les obstacles à l&#39;adoption des technologies bas-carbone et propose des extensions réplicables à d&#39;autres modèles pour que les IAM restent des outils pertinents pour guider les politiques climatiques actuelles et futures.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Thibault Briera (2024)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2024\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Lever les obstacles aux investissements bas-carbone : explorations quantitatives à l'aide de Modèles d'Évaluation Intégrée\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Thibault Briera (2024)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/tel-05094058\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                HALId: tel-05094058\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        <div class=\"document-item\" id=\"cite-doi-10-1088-1748-9326-abe5d8-msg-1752138352746\">\n            <div class=\"document-number\" style=\"margin-right: 0.5em;\">6a</div>\n            <div class=\"document-content\">\n                <h4 class=\"document-title\"\n                    data-doc-title=\"Exploring the possibility space: Taking stock of the diverse capabilities and gaps in integrated assessment models\"\n                    data-doc-description=\"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have emerged as key tools for building and assessing long term climate mitigation scenarios. Due to their central role in the recent IPCC assessments, and international climate policy analyses more generally, and the high uncertainties related to future projections, IAMs have been critically assessed by scholars from different fields receiving various critiques ranging from adequacy of their methods to how their results are used and communicated. Although IAMs are conceptually diverse and evolved in very different directions, they tend to be criticized under the umbrella of &quot;IAMs&quot;. Here we first briefly summarise the IAM landscape and how models differ from each other. We then proceed to discuss six prominent critiques emerging from the recent literature, reflect and respond to them in the light of IAM diversity and ongoing work and suggest ways forward. The six critiques relate to (1) representation of heterogeneous actors in the models, (2) modelling of technology diffusion and dynamics, (3) representation of capital markets, (4) energy-economy feedbacks, (5) policy scenarios, and (6) interpretation and use of model results.\"\n                    data-doc-authors=\"Ilkka Keppo, Isabela Butnar, Nicolas Bauer, Matteo Caspani, Oreane Edelenbosch, Johannes Emmerling, Panagiotis Fragkos, Céline Guivarch, Mathijs Harmsen, Julien Lefevre, Thomas Le Gallic, Marian Leimbach, Will Mcdowall, Jean-Francois Mercure, Roberto Schaeffer, Evelina Trutnevyte, Fabian Wagner (2021)\"\n                    data-doc-year=\"2021\"\n                    onmouseover=\"showTooltip(event, this)\"\n                    onmouseout=\"hideTooltip()\">\n                    Exploring the possibility space: Taking stock of the diverse capabilities and gaps in integrated assessment models\n                </h4>\n                <p class=\"document-authors\">Ilkka Keppo, Isabela Butnar, Nicolas Bauer, Matteo Caspani, Oreane Edelenbosch, Johannes Emmerling, Panagiotis Fragkos, Céline Guivarch, Mathijs Harmsen, Julien Lefevre, Thomas Le Gallic, Marian Leimbach, Will Mcdowall, Jean-Francois Mercure, Roberto Schaeffer, Evelina Trutnevyte, Fabian Wagner (2021)</p>\n                <p class=\"document-links\">\n            <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abe5d8\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/abe5d8\n            </a>\n        \n            <a href=\"https://hal.science/hal-03142411\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 flex items-center\">\n                <span class=\"mr-1\">🔗</span>\n                HALId: hal-03142411\n            </a>\n        </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n        </div>\n    "
