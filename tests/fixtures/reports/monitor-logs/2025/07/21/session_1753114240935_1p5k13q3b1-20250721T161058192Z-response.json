        "generated_answer": "The timeline for implementing the ban on diesel and petrol motorcycles in Hanoi by July 2026 might indeed be considered rushed, given the current state of infrastructure and supporting mechanisms for electric vehicles (EVs). Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Development**: The transition to electric vehicles requires significant infrastructure development, including charging stations, battery recycling facilities, and smart grid systems [3d79b67]. These developments take time and substantial investment.\n\n2. **Battery Recycling**: The most popular models of electric scooters currently use lead-acid batteries, which pose environmental risks if not properly recycled. Developing an efficient recycling system is crucial and will take time to implement [3d79b67].\n\n3. **Policy and Planning**: The Vietnamese government has shown a willingness to transition to cleaner energy sources, but the implementation of such policies can be slow. For instance, the government has been cautious in touching the energy sector, and investors are wary of stranded assets [332b801], [daf1223]. This caution could also apply to the transition from petrol and diesel motorcycles to electric ones.\n\n4. **Comparative Examples**: Other cities and countries have set longer timelines for similar transitions. For example, Beijing aims to reduce the share of fuel-powered vehicles to 0% by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2020, 2030, and 2040 [b00f55a]. France plans to ban all internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040, while Norway and the Netherlands aim to do so by 2025 and 2030, respectively [193f23d].\n\n5. **Economic and Social Considerations**: The livelihoods of many people depend on petrol and diesel motorcycles. A rushed transition could disproportionately affect these individuals, highlighting the need for a more gradual approach that includes support mechanisms for those affected [3d79b67].\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to argue that the timeline for the ban might be too rushed. A more gradual approach, coupled with significant investment in infrastructure and support for affected individuals, would likely be more effective in achieving the goal of reducing air pollution without causing undue economic and social disruption. The exact time required for such preparations would depend on various factors, including the pace of infrastructure development, policy implementation, and public acceptance.",

Priorité aux instruments non tarifaires Dominique FINON, Directeur de recherche CNRS émérite Novembre 2019 Soumis à la Revue d'Economie Politique Résumé La tarification du carbone n'est pas appropriée en tant qu'instrument principal des politiques climatiques dans les économies émergents et en développement, du fait des contraintes d'économie politique qui sont plus importantes que celles qui, dans les pays de l'OCDE, rendent déjà délicat l'usage du prix du carbone. Les instruments autres que le prix-normes d'efficacité, régulation baséesur des instruments market-based, subventions aux technologies propres, programmes publics d'infrastructures-doivent être utilisés de préférence à la tarification du carbone pour orienter les choix technologiques et les infrastructures qui sont les principaux moyens de réaliser l'objectif carbone. En outre, même si, en théorie, les ensembles de mesures utilisant des instruments autres que les prix du carbone sont moins efficaces socialement, ils permettent aux gouvernements de contourner les contraintes d'économie politique, car leurs coûts pour les consommateurs et les citoyens sont moins importants, moins visibles et plus circonscrits que les effets de la tarification du carbone, tandis qu'ils ne sont moins régressifs. Mots-clés: politique publique, environnement (changement climatique), pays en développement, taxation, règlementation, redistribution, The political economy of climate policy instruments in developing countries: Priority to non price instrument Summary Carbon pricing might not be appropriate as the main element of the carbon policy package in emerging and developing countries (DCs), because the political economy constraints are greater than in developed countries. Non-price instruments and policies such as efficiency standards, market-oriented regulation, subsidies for clean technologies and public programs involving low carbon infrastructure should be preferentially developed to deal with market and regulatory failures, which are more widespread than in developed countries. These approaches are most effective in orientating technology and infrastructure, the principal means to achieving the mitigation imperative in DCs. Moreover, even if, in theory, policy packages using non-price instruments are less socially efficient than those focused on carbon pricing, they allow governments to circumvent political economy constraints, because their costs to consumers and citizens are not generalized and tend to be much less visible, while their redistributive effects are, if appropriately designed, generally not too regressive.",

                "description": "Policy instruments on passenger vehicle emissions aim at reducing negative environmental externalities from vehicles use. To regulate CO2 emissions, fuel economy standards have been put in place in Europe and in the US, among others. These standards are made more stringent over time. This thesis analyzes how automotive firms anticipate and prepare their future technology portfolio to comply with expected future standards. To do so, we develop a model of optimal technology choice that captures technology diffusion constraints.With this framework, this thesis investigates three policy questions. First, we ask how the form of anticipation can affect near- and long-term technology choices. We find that focusing solely on near-term objectives can lead to failure to comply with a long-term target. In fact, meeting the near-term target is not a necessary nor a sufficient condition to satisfy long-term compliance. Moreover, when there is partial anticipation, as in a myopic view of the future, technology choices will be stuck with low abatement technologies creating a path dependency that limits long-term abatement potential.Second, we ask how much indexing fuel economy standard to mass (as in Europe or China) changes the optimal technology. We show that, for the same emission target, there is no significant difference in the social cost of mobility for an average vehicle with and without mass index. Thus a heavier vehicle fleet has the same cost than a lighter one. However, the technology choices are different, and mass indexed fuel economy standards lead to sidestepping lightweight technologies despite being cost effective from a CO2 emissions abatement point of view.Third, we ask how technology choices change when policies with multiple objectives overlap. We focus on two externalities associated with mobility: CO2 emissions and local air pollution. We show three type of effects of overlapping policies. First, a technology specific policy such as the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate in combination with a fuel economy standard induces carmakers to develop more expensive green technologies and prevents cheap, dirty technologies from disappearing compared to the case of a fuel economy standard alone. Second, the combination of policies can lead to very high costs when technologies adapted to each policy are very different. Third, we find an ambiguous effect of overlapping policies relative to single-objective policy in terms of emissions performance.",

The potential effects of the following alternative policy options are examined: energy efficiency, favorably imported generation fuels, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and an internalized positive carbon value. The baseline in terms of cumulative CO2 emissions over 2010-2030 is 3.6 Gt. Lighting energy efficiency improvements offers 14% of no-regret abatement of CO2 emissions. Developing nuclear and renewable energy could help meet the challenges of the increases in electricity demand, the dependence on imported fuels for electricity generation in the context of carbon constraints applied in a developing country. When CO2 costs increase from 1 $/t to 30 $/t, building 10 GW of nuclear generation capacity implies an increase in abatement levels from 24% to 46%. Using renewable energy abates CO2 levels by between 14% and 46%. At 2 $/tCO2, the model predicts an abatement of 0.77 Gt from using wind power at prime locations as well as energy from small hydro, wood residue and wood plantations, suggesting Clean Development Mechanism opportunities. At 10 $/tCO2, the model predicts an abatement of 1.4 Gt when efficient gas plants are substituted for coal generation and when the potential for wind energy is economically developed further than in the former model.",

This paper attempts to address this question by investigating the driving forces of transport demand and relevant policy measures that facilitate mitigating GHG emissions in the urban transport sector in Indian cities based on a critical review of the literature. Our overview of existing literature and international experiences suggests that it is critical to improve urban governance in transport infrastructure quality and develop efficient public transport, coupled with integrated land use/transport planning as well as economic instruments. This will allow Indian cities to embark on a sustainable growth pathway by decoupling transport services demand of GHG emissions in the longer term. Appropriate policy instruments need to be selected to reconcile the imperatives of economic and urban growth, aspiration to higher quality of life, improvements in social welfare, urban transportrelated energy consumption and GHG emissions mitigation target in Indian cities.",

              "description": "This report shows the impacts of coal mining and coal-based electricity generation on the Vietnamese society and environment. Five impacts categories were examined: water, air and soil pollution, local people’s livelihood and health. We studied impacts now and extrapolated according to Vietnam’s current Power Development Plan –namely PDP VII revised– which prescribes to expand the coal-fired power capacity from about 10 GW today in 2015 to 55 GW by 2030. Results show that coal mining and coal-based electricity generation have high, unsustainable, local impacts. Our studies found that levels of dust in the air systematically exceeded the legal safe standards. So did the level of heavy metals and other toxic pollutants in the water we studied. We observed resettlement issues which were not solved appropriately, and local job creation promises which were not followed up in action. We assess that by 2030, Vietnam’s coal power plants would create 30 million tonnes of coal ash to be disposed. We estimate that the PDP VII entails importing at least 50 million tonnes of coal per year in 2030. This would compromise energy independence, creating national security risks. We argue further that a fivefold expansion of coal power generation capacity is incompatible with the humanity’s goal of stabilizing climate change below 2°C of global warming. In conclusion, we propose engineering and public policy recommendations towards the green growth strategy of Vietnam, which would better integrate the country in the world’s energy transition towards a low carbon society.",

Priorité aux instruments non tarifaires Dominique FINON, Directeur de recherche CNRS émérite Novembre 2019 Soumis à la Revue d'Economie Politique Résumé La tarification du carbone n'est pas appropriée en tant qu'instrument principal des politiques climatiques dans les économies émergents et en développement, du fait des contraintes d'économie politique qui sont plus importantes que celles qui, dans les pays de l'OCDE, rendent déjà délicat l'usage du prix du carbone. Les instruments autres que le prix-normes d'efficacité, régulation baséesur des instruments market-based, subventions aux technologies propres, programmes publics d'infrastructures-doivent être utilisés de préférence à la tarification du carbone pour orienter les choix technologiques et les infrastructures qui sont les principaux moyens de réaliser l'objectif carbone. En outre, même si, en théorie, les ensembles de mesures utilisant des instruments autres que les prix du carbone sont moins efficaces socialement, ils permettent aux gouvernements de contourner les contraintes d'économie politique, car leurs coûts pour les consommateurs et les citoyens sont moins importants, moins visibles et plus circonscrits que les effets de la tarification du carbone, tandis qu'ils ne sont moins régressifs. Mots-clés: politique publique, environnement (changement climatique), pays en développement, taxation, règlementation, redistribution, The political economy of climate policy instruments in developing countries: Priority to non price instrument Summary Carbon pricing might not be appropriate as the main element of the carbon policy package in emerging and developing countries (DCs), because the political economy constraints are greater than in developed countries. Non-price instruments and policies such as efficiency standards, market-oriented regulation, subsidies for clean technologies and public programs involving low carbon infrastructure should be preferentially developed to deal with market and regulatory failures, which are more widespread than in developed countries. These approaches are most effective in orientating technology and infrastructure, the principal means to achieving the mitigation imperative in DCs. Moreover, even if, in theory, policy packages using non-price instruments are less socially efficient than those focused on carbon pricing, they allow governments to circumvent political economy constraints, because their costs to consumers and citizens are not generalized and tend to be much less visible, while their redistributive effects are, if appropriately designed, generally not too regressive.",

              "description": "Policy instruments on passenger vehicle emissions aim at reducing negative environmental externalities from vehicles use. To regulate CO2 emissions, fuel economy standards have been put in place in Europe and in the US, among others. These standards are made more stringent over time. This thesis analyzes how automotive firms anticipate and prepare their future technology portfolio to comply with expected future standards. To do so, we develop a model of optimal technology choice that captures technology diffusion constraints.With this framework, this thesis investigates three policy questions. First, we ask how the form of anticipation can affect near- and long-term technology choices. We find that focusing solely on near-term objectives can lead to failure to comply with a long-term target. In fact, meeting the near-term target is not a necessary nor a sufficient condition to satisfy long-term compliance. Moreover, when there is partial anticipation, as in a myopic view of the future, technology choices will be stuck with low abatement technologies creating a path dependency that limits long-term abatement potential.Second, we ask how much indexing fuel economy standard to mass (as in Europe or China) changes the optimal technology. We show that, for the same emission target, there is no significant difference in the social cost of mobility for an average vehicle with and without mass index. Thus a heavier vehicle fleet has the same cost than a lighter one. However, the technology choices are different, and mass indexed fuel economy standards lead to sidestepping lightweight technologies despite being cost effective from a CO2 emissions abatement point of view.Third, we ask how technology choices change when policies with multiple objectives overlap. We focus on two externalities associated with mobility: CO2 emissions and local air pollution. We show three type of effects of overlapping policies. First, a technology specific policy such as the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate in combination with a fuel economy standard induces carmakers to develop more expensive green technologies and prevents cheap, dirty technologies from disappearing compared to the case of a fuel economy standard alone. Second, the combination of policies can lead to very high costs when technologies adapted to each policy are very different. Third, we find an ambiguous effect of overlapping policies relative to single-objective policy in terms of emissions performance.",
