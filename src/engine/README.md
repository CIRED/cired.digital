*Notes:*

. Scripts in `smoke-tests/` require `uv` since it uses `uvx` to pull the `r2r` SDK.

. This `engine/` directory started as a copy of `docker/` directory from R2R repository, with our own scripts and configuration files. If upstream changes, we have to manually review and sync. To that end, the dir `config.upstream` can be created by `ops/install.sh` and deleted by `ops/clean.sh`. In particular, `compose.yaml` is a copy of `config.upstream/compose.full.yaml` .
