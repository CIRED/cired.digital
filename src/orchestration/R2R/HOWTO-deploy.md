## Update the distant production data from local development data

1. Run snapshot.sh on the local development server.
2. Transfer the snapshot to VPS. It is timestapped in cired.digital/data/archived/R2R/ .
3. Ensure that the VPS (production server) can be stopped, nobody is connected.
4. Run restore.sh on the VPS.

The scripts pair snapshot.sh / restore.sh can also be used for recovery.

Note: 
The restore.sh script does not inject the secret API_KEYS to the environment before calling docker compose.
Warnings about these are normal.
